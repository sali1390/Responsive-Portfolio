						<p>My name is Saleema Ali and I am a graphic designer located in Orlando, FL. Originally from Trinidad, I grew up in Miami, FL until I left home at the age of 17 to attend the University of Florida.
						<br><br>
						After a couple of years of career goal dead ends, ranging from broadcast news to video production, I landed in graphic design, dabbling very lightly in web design. And after 2 years of working for a local marketing firm as a graphic designer, I picked up the random skill of email development. I now spend the majority of my time designing and coding emails. 
						<br><br>
						After re-visiting web design for work, I decided to return to school at UCF to pursue a degree in web design. Unfortunately, I wasn't a huge fan of their approach to the content, so I sought better solutions. And that was when I found the UCF Coding Bootcamp!</p>
